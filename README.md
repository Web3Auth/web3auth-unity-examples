[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io) is a pluggable auth infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. It streamlines the onboarding of both mainstream and crypto native users within a minute by providing experiences they're most comfortable with.

With support for social logins, web & mobile native platforms, wallets and other key management methods, Web3Auth results in a standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and application.
